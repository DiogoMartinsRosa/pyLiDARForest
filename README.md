# pyLiDARForest

This repository will contain a group of Python routines to process LiDAR data collected in forestry.

Some notes about it:

2) The routines are based in some "science" Python libraries, like numpy and scipy. You can install it in your Python environment, but I suggest you install and use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a Python environment including many libraries to deal with math & science, and of course, numpy & scipy.

1) Some routines use laspy, a Python library that provides access to LAS files. So, you should install laspy before use 

I´m using Visual Studio as editor, the main file of the group is pyLiDARForest.sln. To use it, you can download and install any version of Visual Studio (including Community Edition, that´s free) and then install Python Tools for Visual Studio.
Of course, you can use any editor you want, the libraries will work nicely.

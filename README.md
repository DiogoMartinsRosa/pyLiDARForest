# pyLiDARForest

This repository contains a bunch of Python routines to process LiDAR data collected in forestry.

Some notes about it:

1) The library is developed and tested using Python 2.7 in an Anaconda Windows version environment, 64 bits. You can try it in another environments, and fell free to contact me if you have any issue that you think I could fix. 

2) Some routines use [laspy](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/python-vs.aspx), a Python library that provides access to LAS files. So, you should install laspy before use.

3) The routines are based in some "science" Python libraries, like numpy and scipy. You can install it in your Python environment, but I suggest you install and use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a Python environment including many libraries to deal with math & science, and of course, numpy & scipy.

4) I´m using Visual Studio as editor, the solution file is pyLiDARForest.sln. To use it, you can download and install any version of Visual Studio, including [Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx), that´s free, and then install [Python Tools for Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx).

Of course, you can use any editor you want, the libraries will work nicely.

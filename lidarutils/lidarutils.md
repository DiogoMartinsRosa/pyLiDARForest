#LiDAR Utils

This library contains a group of routines developed by me & Eric Gorgens to implement some useful features for people that deals with forestry LiDAR clouds.

It can be used as a command line python application:

python lidarutils.py <filename> <options>

or as a library to be imported and used in other python apps.
